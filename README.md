#### üí≥ User purchase flow


The process for initiating a rental session goes as follows:

1. Select the item

2. Create an account

3. Attach a Credit Card

4. Rent out the item

#### ü§ù Rental Session protocol:


Terminology: 

Renter = Person renting the item

Lender = Person lending out the item

When two renters/lenders are in a transaction, the process goes as follows:

1. Someone requests a time and place to meet up for the lender to give the item to the renter

2. The other party has to accept that request

3. They scan QR codes. This is done to ensure that the renter and lender have actually met up, and can be used in insurance/damage claims if the lender destroys the item.

4. Someone requests a time and place to meet up to return the item 

5. The other party accepts that request

6. They scan QR codes to confirm in our database that the renter returned the item to the lender

7. The lender is paid out on the QR code scan
